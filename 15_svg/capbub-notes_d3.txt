Prediction 1: An alert pops up of the name clicked
Answer 1: Correct

Prediction 2: Alert pops up twice and I think the order is
              name, row, table because of the order the code
              was written in the JS file.
Answer 2: Correct
Revised Answer 2: After 3rd index page, I learned order is
                  actually the one with the smallest scope.

Prediction 3: Same as 1
Answer 3: An alert pops up of the table. Did not see the extra
          true. Found that the one with the extra parameter
          true will pop up and if multiple trues the one with
          the largest scope will happen

Prediction 4: Tested this during 3rd prediction
